# Titanic
My work on the Kaggle competition using the Titanic data set.
The file titanic-eda contains an initial random forest model on the titanic dataset which produced a 75% result.
This was my baseline for improvement and the rest of the file contains my exploratory data analysis of the titanic dataset.
The ultimate goal is to work towards an 80% or higher result. The second file is titanic-missing-values and contains my work
in filling the numerous missing data points in the given data set.  With missing values filled the only remaining tasks are
breaking passengers into groups and creating the model.
